# Pacman

In order to start the game you need to run main.py. 
You can move pacman using the arrow keys, the ghosts wont start before the first input.
You have 4 lives, you loose one life if you get caught by a ghost while it's not blue.
If you lose all the lives you have, the game ends.
After you eats every dot in the maze you move on to the next level
